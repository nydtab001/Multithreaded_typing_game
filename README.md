The purpose of this project is to create a 2D typing game using multithreading, that displays random words to be typed before reaching the bottom. The random words data is generated from an input dictionary file.

## Running the game

The makefile used to run this project is designed for Linux systems and the execution is done as follows:

a. Place the input file to be used in the main folder where the make file is located

b. Run the command "make" to compile the project

c. Run the command "make run v1=<total words> v2=<words on screen> v3=<dictionary file>" to run the program

e. Use the command "make clean" to remove the compiled classes
